  abstract     = {Recommender systems (RSs) aim at helping users to effectively retrieve items of their interests from a large catalogue. For a quite long time, researchers and practitioners have been focusing on developing accurate RSs. Recent years have witnessed an increasing number of threats to RSs, coming from attacks, system and user generated noise, and various types of biases. As a result, it has become clear that the focus on RS accuracy is too narrow, and the research must consider other important factors, particularly trustworthiness. A trustworthy recommender system (TRS) should not only be accurate but also transparent, unbiased, fair, and robust to noise and attacks. These observations actually led to a paradigm shift of the research on RSs: from accuracy-oriented RSs to TRSs. However, there is a lack of a systematic overview and discussion of the literature in this novel and fast-developing field of TRSs. To this end, in this article, we provide an overview of TRSs, including a discussion of the motivation and basic concepts of TRSs, a presentation of the challenges in building TRSs, and a perspective on the future directions in this area. We also provide a novel conceptual framework to support the construction of TRSs.},
